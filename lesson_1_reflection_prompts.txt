How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It saved a lot of time that would have been wasted if we had just scrolled through the entire code to find that bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Again, it saves time. By having the entire history of a file, we can revert back to the previous point if we ever mess up at any point of time. This is similar to keeping a backup.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatically saved files have a great disadvantage, That is ki I'm bored now.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
